            I am Sahil Nigam, a recent graduate with a Bachelor&apos;s degree
            (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering, actively seeking
            Software Developer roles. My journey into the world of technology
            started during high school as a passionate gamer. Over time, my
            curiosity about building computers evolved into a love for learning
            how they work. I pursued my interest further by enrolling in a
            school-offered programming course, and the thrill of coding and
            creating has stayed with me ever since.

            Today, I have solid programming knowledge and practical experience
            with TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, C++, and C, complemented by
            expertise in web development (MERN Stack and PERN Stack and NextJS)
            along with Backend Python Development (FastAPI) and mobile
            development (React Native). I enjoy leveraging these skills to build
            feature-rich and fully functional applications.

            Beyond the technical realm, I am deeply passionate about sports,
            particularly basketball. I also have an appreciation for music,
            especially rock genres, and enjoy playing the guitar in my free
            time.

            and enthusiasm can make an impact!
